We will use a simple collection `/users/{userId}` to store user data. This path-based ownership allows for straightforward security rules ensuring only the user or an admin can access/modify their data.\n\nThis structure achieves Authorization Independence as no `get()` calls are required to validate ownership. Security rules will simply check `request.auth.uid == userId` for standard user operations. For administrative access, a separate `/roles_admin/{uid}` collection will be used to grant admin privileges. Existence of a document in `/roles_admin/{uid}` indicates admin status.\n\nThis design supports required QAPs by:\n\n1.  Segregation: User data is isolated in their respective `/users/{userId}` documents.\n2.  Path-Based Ownership: Enforces strict access control, preventing unauthorized listing of user data."
