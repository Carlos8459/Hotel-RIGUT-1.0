# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Installing the App on Your Mobile Device

This application is a Progressive Web App (PWA), which means you can install it on your phone's home screen for easy access, just like a native app.

### For Android (using Chrome)

1.  Open Chrome and navigate to the application's URL.
2.  Tap the menu button (three vertical dots) in the top-right corner.
3.  Tap on **"Install app"** or **"Add to Home screen"**.
4.  Follow the on-screen prompts to add the app to your home screen.

### For iOS (using Safari)

1.  Open Safari and navigate to the application's URL.
2.  Tap the "Share" button (a square with an arrow pointing up) at the bottom of the screen.
3.  Scroll down and tap on **"Add to Home Screen"**.
4.  Confirm by tapping "Add" in the top-right corner.

The app icon will now appear on your home screen, allowing you to launch it directly. You and your partners can follow these same steps on your devices.
